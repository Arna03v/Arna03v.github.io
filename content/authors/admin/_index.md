I am a pre-final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, Goa, majoring in Computer Science. My research interests lie in computer systems, specifically distributed systems, storage systems, high-performance computing.

I am working as a student researcher at the Data, Systems, and High-Performance Computing (DaSH) Lab with Prof. Arnab K. Paul on developing a framework which utilises asynchronous I/O calls for key-value stores. I have also worked with Prof. Kunal Kishore Korgaonkar on porting a section of GNSS-SDR from C to Rust to analyse performance and memory safety developments.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, and watching movies, and visiting museums and threatres.
