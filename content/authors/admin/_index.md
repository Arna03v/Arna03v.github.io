I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Goa, passionate about building scalable and highly available software systems. My goal is to work as a software engineer focusing on backend development and distributed computing, tackling the complex challenges that arise in designing and maintaining robust architectures.

I have worked as a student researcher at the Data, Systems, and High-Performance Computing (DaSH) Lab with Prof. [Arnab K. Paul](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=az8MAG0AAAAJ&hl=en), on developing a framework that utilises asynchronous I/O calls for key-value stores. Previously, I have worked with Prof. Kunal [Kishore Korgaonkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8v7yv7oAAAAJ&hl=en) on porting a section of GNSS-SDR from C to Rust to analyse performance and memory safety developments, and with Prof [Swaroop Joshi](https://swaroopjoshi.in/) to build a Visual Studio Code extension for the visually impaired.

I enjoy diving deep into well-thought-out design architectures that effectively address specific problems, finding satisfaction in creating solutions that matter. I am especially drawn to learning from peers who exhibit exceptional understanding, clean problem-solving skills, and an eye for detail — qualities I continuously strive to develop in myself.

Outside of tech, I spend my time reading, watching movies, and exploring museums and theatres. Always looking for new experiences that inspire creativity and curiosity.

## **Industry Impact**
